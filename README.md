# Chemistry Autoencoders and Generative Models
Autoencoders, encoders and decoders, and generative adversarial networks form the basis of many modern generative ML/AI models. This project is a set of basic 
chemistry autoencoders and generative models that can be used as a starting point for building other ML models.

## This project includes:
- A SMILES string autoencoder, using GRU layers.
- A 4-channel molecular graph autoencoder using Dense layers.
- A 4-channel molecular graph autoencoder using Convolutional layers.
- A 4-channel variational molecular graph autoencoder using Convolutional layers.
- a 4 channel molecular graph generative adversarial network using Convolutional layers.
- a 4 channel molecular graph Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty using Convolutional layers.
